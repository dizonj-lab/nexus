## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] — 2026-10-31

### Added
- Test deployment: one site with the prototype at `/` and the LikeC4
  architecture at `/c4/` (`deploy/build-site.sh`, `deploy/Dockerfile`,
  `deploy/nginx.conf`, health check at `/healthz`).
- Deployment to Buddy, the home LLM server (192.168.1.93): Docker Compose
  (`deploy/compose.yml`, port 8088, read-only container) and `deploy/buddy.sh`
  to pull, rebuild and health-check. Standalone NEXUS stack.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-31

Concept baseline: prototype and target architecture.

### Added
- Clickable prototype (`poc/prototype/index.html`):
  - Canvas with animated traffic, green/orange/red status, trust-zone perimeters,
    drag, pan, zoom, sub-designs by double-click, short component IDs.
  - What-if load slider and failure simulation; KPIs for offered load, error rate,
    latency estimate and bottleneck.
  - Design Advisor with findings citing EA principles, Ground Truth and MITRE
    ATT&CK, one-click fixes, draft ADRs, quantified justification per component.
  - Generated Terraform (AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware) with checks, and LikeC4.
  - Animated Design Tree with magnifier.
  - Console with natural-language commands, guided discovery and saved versions.
  - Versioned Technical Capabilities, EA Principles and Ground Truth panes;
    file ingestion (PDF, DOCX, JPG, PNG; tagging only).
  - Flow, Flat, 3D and Relations views; AI log; model settings.
- Target architecture in LikeC4 (`architecture/likec4/nexus.c4`) with context,
  containers, MCP and what-if views.
- Docs: architecture, decisions D1–D8, roadmap WP0–WP8, current state.

### Known limitations
- No AI model is called; the advisor is a rules engine standing in for the SLM.
- Uploaded files are tagged by filename; their contents are not read.
- Simulation is an analytical capacity model, not a forecast.
- Generated Terraform has not been run through `terraform validate`.
- State lives in the browser's local storage only.
